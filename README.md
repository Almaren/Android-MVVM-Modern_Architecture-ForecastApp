# Android ForecastApp implemented using MVVM and Modern Architecture concepts.
Implementation based on tutorials from: https://resocoder.com/
*The main difference of the mentioned tutorials:*

* Using **Koin** instead of *Kodein*.
* ViewModels keeps LiveData. DAO not returns LiveData objects.
* Unit system via Enum.
* Coroutines use different implementation.
* Standard RecycleView instead of third library.
